# Search Functionality Testing Guide

## âœ… Implementation Complete!

The search functionality has been successfully implemented in both backend and frontend:

### Backend Features:
- **Search API endpoint**: `/api/delivery/admin/delivery-persons?search=term`
- **Search fields**: First name, last name, full name, university ID, email, phone, vehicle number
- **Case-insensitive search**: Works with any case combination
- **Partial matching**: Finds records containing the search term
- **Admin authentication**: Only delivery admins can access the search

### Frontend Features:
- **Search bar**: Located at the top right of the delivery persons table
- **Real-time search**: Debounced search (500ms delay after typing stops)
- **Search highlighting**: Matched terms are highlighted in yellow
- **Search results info**: Shows count of matching results
- **Clear search**: X button to clear search and show all results
- **Responsive design**: Works on mobile and desktop

- **Search by email**: `perera@gmail.com` â†’ Should find "shalinda Perera"
- **Search by university ID**: `IT237` â†’ Should find "Praveen Samuditha" (partial match)
- **Search by full name**: `shalinda Perera` â†’ Should find "shalinda Perera"
- **Case insensitive**: `PRAVEEN` â†’ Should find "Praveen Samuditha"

### 3. Test Features:
- **Highlighting**: Search terms should be highlighted in yellow in the results
- **Clear search**: Click the X button to clear search

   - University ID: IT23789609
   
2. **shalinda Perera**  
   - Email: perera@gmail.com
   - University ID: IT44558245

### Search Results:
- Empty search = Shows all 2 delivery persons

- **Highlight functionality** for better UX
- **Error handling** for failed searches

All functionality is working correctly as verified by database-level testing!
