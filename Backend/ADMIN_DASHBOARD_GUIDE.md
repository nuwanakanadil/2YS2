## ðŸ”§ Quick Tests

## ðŸ“Š Data Structure Expected

The system expects delivery persons in the database with:
- `role: 'delivery_person'` (for regular delivery persons)
- `role: 'delivery_admin'` (for admin users)

Admin dashboard only shows delivery persons with `role: 'delivery_person'`.

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

If you still don't see data:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify backend server is running on port 5000
3. Ensure admin account has `role: 'delivery_admin'`
4. Confirm delivery persons have `role: 'delivery_person'`
5. Check Network tab in DevTools for API responses
