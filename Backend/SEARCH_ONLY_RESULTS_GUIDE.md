# Search-Only Results Implementation âœ…

## What Changed

The delivery admin dashboard now displays **ONLY search results** when performing a search, instead of showing all delivery persons with highlighting.

## ðŸ”„ Updated Behavior

### Before:
- Search would show ALL delivery persons
- Matched terms were highlighted
- All results remained visible

### After:
- Search shows **ONLY matching delivery persons**
- Clear search to see all delivery persons again
- Better visual indicators for search mode

## ðŸŽ¨ New Visual Features

### 1. **Search Mode Indicators:**
- Search input field turns pink when active
- "Search Mode" chip appears next to search bar
- Search icon turns pink during search

### 2. **Updated Headers:**
- "Delivery Persons Management" â†’ "Search Results" (during search)
- Shows current search term being used

### 3. **Enhanced Info Messages:**
- Blue banner explains only search results are shown
- Instructions to clear search for all results
- Better empty state messages

### 4. **Improved Empty States:**
- Different messages for "no search results" vs "no delivery persons"
- "Show All Delivery Persons" button when no search results found

## ðŸ§ª How to Test

1. **Navigate to admin dashboard**
2. **Search for anything** (e.g., "Praveen")
3. **Observe**: Only matching results appear
4. **Notice**: Pink search indicators and "Search Mode" chip
5. **Clear search**: Click X or press Escape to see all results again

## ðŸ“‹ Test Cases
